    "learn.predict(\"A CT scan was performed which showed a possibility that the lung was trapped by tumor and that there were some adhesions. The patient then underwent thoracoscopy which confirmed the presence of a pleural peel of tumor and multiple adhesions which were taken down. Two chest tubes were subsequently placed. These were left in place for approximately four days after which a TALC slurry was infused and the chest tubes were removed the following day. Because of the significant pleural peel and the trapped lungs, it is clearly possible that the pleurodesis will not be successful and this was explained to the patient and the family prior to the procedure. Of note, we started her on Megace during this hospitalization because she was having significant nausea and vomiting with the Arimidex that she had been taking. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP The patient is being transferred to an extended-care facility near her home, where she will remain until she has enough strength to go home.\")"
